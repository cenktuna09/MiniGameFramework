### Design Patterns & Principles
- **SOLID Principles**: Enforced throughout framework
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling via events
- **ServiceLocator Pattern**: Core service location (DI if time permits)
- **State Machine**: For game flow management
- **Object Pooling**: For performance optimization (Runner obstacles)
- **Simple Animations**: Unity AnimationCurve + Lerp for polish

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy
- **System-Level Testers**: Every major system has dedicated Tester class (UIFrameworkTester, GameStateManagerTester, etc.)
- **Auto-Generated Test Scenes**: Unity MenuItem creates complete test environments with UI
- **Real-Time Testing**: Live displays showing system state, transitions, and test results
- **Automated Test Sequences**: Full test suites run automatically on scene start
- **Manual Control Integration**: Developer can trigger specific tests and scenarios
- **Event System Validation**: All testers verify event publishing/subscription
- **Performance Verification**: 60 FPS stability testing during all operations
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Every tester validates service initialization and dependency resolution

## 🚧 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Areas & Mitigation
1. **Time Management (Critical)**
   - *Risk*: 72-hour constraint with ambitious scope
   - *Mitigation*: Strict MVP focus, daily checkpoints
   - *Fallback*: Remove advanced features, focus on core functionality

2. **Match-3 Complexity**
   - *Risk*: Board generation and match detection algorithms
   - *Mitigation*: Start with simple random generation
   - *Fallback*: Manual board layouts, basic match detection only

3. **Performance Optimization**

## 📝 Development Notes & Key Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Rationale
1. **ServiceLocator First, DI Later**: Avoid over-engineering early, upgrade if time permits
2. **Event-Driven Design**: Ensures loose coupling and easy testing
3. **PC-First Development**: Avoid mobile complexity until core is solid
4. **Simple Animations**: Focus on functionality, add polish incrementally
5. **TDD for Core Systems**: Catch issues early, ensure reliability

### Interview Preparation Strategy
1. **Practice Demo Flow**: Rehearse 5-minute presentation multiple times
2. **Prepare Architecture Explanation**: Be ready to explain design decisions
3. **Code Walkthrough Ready**: Know where to find key architectural elements
4. **Performance Story**: Understand optimization choices and trade-offs
5. **Extension Examples**: Show how to add new mini-games easily

### Code Organization Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear, focused purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Systems can be extended without modification
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not implementations
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces over large ones
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Use components and services

This roadmap prioritizes interview success through clean architecture, working prototypes, and demonstrable technical competence. The phased approach ensures a working product at each milestone with clear fallback strategies.
